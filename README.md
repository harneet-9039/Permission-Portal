MNNIT Allahabad is an institute of national importance. Each day certain
events take place in the institute. These events are conducted either at institute
level or at department level. Various events like Freshers, Farewell, Alumni
Meet, Seminar on various topics, Culrav, Avishkar, etc. are conducted every
year.<br><br>
For organizing any event, the main responsibility is on the shoulders of students. So the students have to take permission from various departments for
conducting their event successfully. They have to get a venue assigned to them
for the event. Students don't know about the entire process of taking permission
as for each venue, permission is to be taken from different departments. Also, one doesn't know which venue is available at one time.<br><br>
Permission Portal eases the task of generating applications and getting
permission from the concerned departments. It shows you the available venues
for your event. And it automatically redirects the application to the concerned
department. Current Status of the application is shown beside each application. This reduces paperwork and also the valuable time of students as well as faculty.

A lot of manual work is involved in getting permission for any venue. Also, a
lot of valuable time is wasted in the whole process. It also involves a lot of
paperwork.<br><br>
